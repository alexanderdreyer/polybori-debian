polybori (0.5~rc1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Boost 1.39 has removed the "-mt" suffix, so revert the previous change
    (and update the build dependency to 1.39) (Closes: #545608).

polybori (0.5~rc1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix FTBFS with current boost (Closes: #530478). As explained by Steve
    M. Robbins, single- and multi-threaded variants got dropped, only mt
    variants are available as of 1.37.0, suffixed with “-mt”. Since the
    previous filenames aren't specified, make sure a “modern” version of
    boost headers are used, bumping the versioned build dependency from
    “>= 1.33” to “>= 1.37”, and tweak SConstruct to use “boost_python-mt”
    instead of “boost_python” for the LIBS variable, using the following
    patch:
     - 01-fix-ftbfs-with-new-boost.diff
