Description: Polynomials over Boolean Rings, Python module
 The core of PolyBoRi is a C++ library, which provides high-level data
 types for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as
 well as for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the
 powerset of the Boolean variables. As a unique approach, binary
 decision diagrams are used as internal storage type for polynomial
 structures. On top of this C++-library we provide a Python
 interface. This allows parsing of complex polynomial systems, as well
 as sophisticated and extendable strategies for Groebner base
 computation. PolyBoRi features a powerful reference implementation
 for Groebner basis computation.
 .
 This package contains the PolyBoRi Python module and ipbori program.
